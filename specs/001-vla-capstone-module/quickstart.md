# Quickstart: Module 5: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Branch**: `001-vla-capstone-module` | **Date**: 2025-12-13 | **Plan**: `specs/001-vla-capstone-module/plan.md`

## Module Overview

This Quickstart guide provides an overview of Module 5: Vision-Language-Action (VLA), a key component of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module is designed for students to understand the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics, focusing on how natural language commands are translated into physical actions for autonomous humanoids.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this module, students will be able to:

*   Define the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm and its role in generalized robotics.
*   Explain the Voice-to-Action pipeline, including speech recognition and cognitive planning.
*   Outline the steps involved in the Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project, specifically vision integration and action execution through ROS 2.
*   Interpret conceptual flowcharts and Python pseudocode illustrating the VLA data and control flow.

## Getting Started with the Content

The content for this module is structured into several sections, each building upon the previous one:

*   **5.0 The VLA Paradigm**: Introduces the core concepts of VLA.
*   **5.1 Voice-to-Action Pipeline**: Details how voice commands are converted into actionable text.
*   **5.2 Cognitive Planning**: Explains how LLMs translate text commands into ROS 2 actions.
*   **5.3 Capstone Integration**: Sets the stage for the Capstone Project by integrating previous modules' concepts.
*   **5.4 The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project and VLA Future**: Finalizes the Capstone scope and looks at the future of VLA.

## Key Concepts

*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: The convergence of LLMs and robotics for intelligent control.
*   **OpenAI Whisper**: A key technology for voice-to-text conversion.
*   **Cognitive Planning**: The LLM-driven process of generating action sequences from high-level commands.
*   **ROS 2**: The robotics operating system for action execution.
*   **Autonomous Humanoid**: The robotic platform used for practical application.

## Next Steps

Begin by reviewing the `plan.md` for the detailed content generation strategy and the `spec.md` for the feature requirements.
