# Research: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Module

**Decision**: The primary sources of information for this module will be the official documentation for ROS 2, Gazebo, and Unity, with a focus on their integration points (e.g., `ros_gz`, `ROS-Unity-Bridge`).

**Rationale**: To ensure accuracy and adherence to best practices, the official documentation is paramount. This is especially important for explaining the principles of physics and sensor modeling, as these are complex topics that require authoritative sources. Cross-referencing the integration-specific documentation will ensure the explanations of how ROS 2 communicates with these simulators are correct.

**Alternatives considered**: While many community tutorials exist, they can quickly become outdated. Given the technical depth required for this module, relying on the official, maintained documentation is the most reliable approach to deliver accurate and high-quality content.
