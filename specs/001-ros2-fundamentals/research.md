# Research: ROS 2 Fundamentals Module

**Decision**: The primary source of information for developing the content for the ROS 2 Fundamentals module will be the official ROS 2 documentation, with a focus on the `rclpy` client library.

**Rationale**: Using the official documentation ensures that the information presented is accurate, up-to-date, and aligns with best practices. The emphasis on `rclpy` is due to the course's focus on Python for AI agent integration. Recent tutorials will be cross-referenced to ensure the code examples are modern and easy to understand for students.

**Alternatives considered**: While there are many third-party tutorials and books on ROS 2, they may not be as current as the official documentation. To maintain the quality and accuracy of the textbook, the official documentation will be the authoritative source.
