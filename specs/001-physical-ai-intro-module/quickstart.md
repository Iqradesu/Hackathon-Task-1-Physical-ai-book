# Quickstart: Contributing to Module 1

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-intro-module` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

This document provides a brief overview for developers and content creators working on the "Introduction to Physical AI" module.

## File Structure

The source content for this module is located in the `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/docs/introduction-to-physical-ai/` directory.

## Task Overview

The primary task is to populate the five markdown files listed above with detailed, comprehensive, and well-researched content according to the guidelines in `plan.md` and `spec.md`.

### Key Requirements
-   **Total Word Count**: Must exceed 2,500 words across all five files.
-   **Content Focus**: The material is conceptual and descriptive. Do not include implementation details for ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, or NVIDIA Isaac SDKs.
-   **Citations**: Use APA style for all citations.
-   **Visuals**: Use placeholders like `[DIAGRAM: ...]` to suggest where diagrams should be added.

## Testing

Content is validated manually against the four checks defined in the `plan.md` testing strategy:
1.  **Content Scope Check**: Ensure forbidden topics are not discussed.
2.  **Definition Check**: Verify clear definitions of "Physical AI" and "embodied intelligence".
3.  **Sensor Check**: Confirm all four sensor types are covered in detail.
4.  **Word Count Check**: Ensure the total word count is over the 2,500-word minimum.
