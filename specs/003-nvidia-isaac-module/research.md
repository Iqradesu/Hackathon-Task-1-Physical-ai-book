# Research: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) Module

**Decision**: The primary sources of information for this module will be official NVIDIA documentation for Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, supplemented by modern robotics papers focusing on bipedal navigation challenges.

**Rationale**: Official NVIDIA documentation is crucial for accurate technical details regarding VSLAM, hardware acceleration, and the functionalities of Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. Modern robotics papers are necessary to adequately explain the unique complexities of Nav2 when applied to bipedal (humanoid) movement, as this is a specific technical requirement for the module.

**Alternatives considered**: While community forums and general robotics literature offer insights, direct engagement with NVIDIA's official resources and specialized academic papers will ensure the highest level of accuracy and depth required for a university-level textbook.
