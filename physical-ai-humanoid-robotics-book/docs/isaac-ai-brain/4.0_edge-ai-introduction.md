# 4.0 The Edge AI Stack: Introduction to the Isaac Platform

## What is Edge AI?

Edge AI refers to running **AI models directly on robots or devices**.  
Instead of sending data to the cloud, processing happens locally.

This reduces **latency, bandwidth usage, and dependency on internet connectivity**.  
Edge AI is critical for real-time robotic decision-making.
