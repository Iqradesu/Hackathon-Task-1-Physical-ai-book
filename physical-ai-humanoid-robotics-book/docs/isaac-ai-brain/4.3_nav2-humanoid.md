# 4.3 Nav2: Advanced Path Planning for Bipedal Movement

## What is Nav2?

**Nav2 (Navigation 2)** is the official **ROS 2 navigation framework**.  
It enables robots to **plan paths, avoid obstacles, and reach goals autonomously**.

Nav2 is commonly used for:
- Mobile robots
- Humanoids
- Bipedal and legged robots

## Core Responsibilities of Nav2

Nav2 handles the full navigation pipeline:

- **Localization**: Determines the robot’s position in the map  
- **Path Planning**: Computes a safe path to the target  
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Reacts to dynamic objects  
- **Control**: Converts paths into motion commands  

Each part runs as a modular ROS 2 component.

## Why Navigation is Hard for Bipedal Robots

Bipedal robots face extra challenges:
- Balance and stability constraints
- Narrow support area (feet instead of wheels)
- Slower, discrete stepping motions
- Higher risk of falls

Nav2 must plan **safe and stable paths**, not just short ones.

## Nav2 and Bipedal Movement

For bipedal robots, Nav2:
- Plans paths suitable for walking instead of rolling
- Avoids sharp turns and unstable surfaces
- Works with higher-level gait and motion controllers
- Allows customization of planners and controllers

Nav2 focuses on *where to go*,  
while gait controllers decide *how to step*.

## Integration with ROS 2

Nav2 is built entirely on ROS 2:
- Uses **topics** for sensor data
- Uses **actions** for navigation goals
- Uses **parameters** for tuning behavior
- Supports **simulation and real robots**

This makes it easy to test in simulation first.

## Summary

Nav2 provides autonomous navigation in ROS 2.  
It handles planning, obstacle avoidance, and control.

When combined with bipedal controllers, it enables safe and intelligent walking robots.
