# 3.0 Digital Twins: The Necessity of Simulation

## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot or system.  
It allows developers to **simulate, test, and optimize** robot behavior before deploying in the real world.

Key points:  
- Mirrors **physical structure, sensors, and actuators**  
- Can simulate **environment interactions** like collisions, friction, and dynamics  
- Helps **detect errors and optimize performance** early

## Why Digital Twins Are Important

- **Reduce risk**: Test robots virtually before real-world deployment  
- **Save time and resources**: Identify issues without damaging hardware  
- **Enable rapid iteration**: Adjust algorithms and designs faster  
- **Support training**: Operators and AI models can learn in simulation

## Example Use Case

Simulating a humanoid robot in a virtual environment:  
- Test **walking algorithms** on uneven terrain  
- Adjust **sensor placements** for better perception  
- Evaluate **energy efficiency** and mechanical performance
