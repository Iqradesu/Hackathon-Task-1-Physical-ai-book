# 3.2 Robot Modeling: URDF and SDF Comparison

## URDF: Unified Robot Description Format

URDF is an XML format used in ROS 2 to define a robot’s **links, joints, sensors, and actuators**.  
It is simple and easy to parse, making it ideal for **ROS 2 nodes and robot control**.  

### Example URDF Snippet

```xml
<robot name="arm_bot">
  <link name="base_link"/>
  <joint name="base_to_elbow" type="revolute">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="elbow_link"/>
  </joint>
</robot>
```
## SDF: Simulation Description Format

SDF is used primarily in Gazebo for simulating full environments.
It supports multiple robots, lights, terrain, physics, and advanced sensors.

Example SDF Snippet
<sdf version="1.6">
  <world name="default">
    <model name="arm_bot"/>
    <light name="sun"/>
  </world>
</sdf>

## Key Differences

URDF: Simple, ROS-focused, good for robot structure and control

SDF: Full simulation, advanced physics, multi-robot environments

Both formats are often used together: URDF for ROS 2 nodes, SDF for Gazebo simulation
