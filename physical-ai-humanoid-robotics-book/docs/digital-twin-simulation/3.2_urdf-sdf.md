# 3.2 Robot Modeling: URDF and SDF Comparison

To simulate a robot, you first need a way to describe it. In the ROS ecosystem, there are two main formats for this: the **Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)** and the **Simulation Description Format (SDF)**.

## URDF: The ROS Standard

As we learned in the previous module, **URDF** is an XML format for representing a robot model. It is the standard format for describing robots in ROS. A URDF file defines the robot's links, joints, and their kinematic and dynamic properties.

URDF is great for describing the kinematics and dynamics of a single robot. However, it has some limitations:

-   It can only describe a single robot. It cannot describe a world with multiple robots, or a robot with multiple, disconnected parts.
-   It cannot describe non-kinematic aspects of a simulation, such as lighting, terrain, or sensors.

## SDF: The Gazebo Standard

The **Simulation Description Format (SDF)** is an XML format for describing a simulation environment, including robots, lights, sensors, and terrain. It is the native format for the Gazebo simulator.

SDF is a superset of URDF. This means that it can do everything that URDF can do, and more. Some of the advantages of SDF over URDF include:

-   It can describe a complete world, including multiple robots, lights, and other objects.
-   It can describe non-kinematic aspects of a simulation, such as lighting, terrain, and sensors.
-   It has a more expressive syntax for describing joints and links.

## URDF vs. SDF: Which one should I use?

So, which format should you use? The answer depends on your needs:

-   If you are only working with a single robot in ROS, and you do not need to simulate a complex environment, then URDF is often sufficient.
-   If you are working with Gazebo, or you need to describe a complete simulation environment, then SDF is the better choice.

Fortunately, you don't always have to choose. Gazebo can automatically convert a URDF file into an SDF file, so you can use the same URDF file for both ROS and Gazebo. However, if you want to take full advantage of Gazebo's features, you may need to create a separate SDF file for your simulation.

Here is a simple example of a URDF snippet:
```xml
<robot name="my_robot">
  <link name="link1">
    ...
  </link>
  <link name="link2">
    ...
  </link>
  <joint name="joint1" type="continuous">
    <parent link="link1"/>
    <child link="link2"/>
  </joint>
</robot>
```

And here is a similar example in SDF:
```xml
<sdf version="1.6">
  <model name="my_robot">
    <link name="link1">
      ...
    </link>
    <link name="link2">
      ...
    </link>
    <joint name="joint1" type="revolute">
      <parent>link1</parent>
      <child>link2</child>
    </joint>
  </model>
</sdf>
```
As you can see, the basic structure is similar, but SDF provides a richer set of options for describing a simulation.
