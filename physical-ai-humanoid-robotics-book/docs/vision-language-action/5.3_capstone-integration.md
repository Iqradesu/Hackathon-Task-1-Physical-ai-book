# 5.3 Capstone Integration: Vision, Navigation, and Manipulation

## What is Capstone Integration?

**Capstone Integration** combines all key Physical AI components:
- **Vision** → perceiving the environment  
- **Navigation** → moving safely and efficiently  
- **Manipulation** → interacting with objects  

This creates a fully functional, autonomous robot capable of **complex tasks**.

## Vision

- Processes camera and sensor data  
- Detects objects, obstacles, and landmarks  
- Provides input for both **navigation and manipulation**  

Example:
- Vision detects a red cube on the table  
- Sends object position to navigation and manipulation modules

---

## Navigation

- Plans paths using **Nav2** or custom planners  
- Avoids obstacles while following goals  
- Works with ROS 2 nodes and actions

Example:
- Move from current location to table without colliding with obstacles  
- Navigation module uses vision and localization input

---

## Manipulation

- Uses robot arms or grippers  
- Executes precise actions like picking, placing, or assembling objects  
- Receives coordinates from vision + instructions from cognitive planning (LLM)

Example:
- Pick up red cube and place it at target location  
- Arm controller executes movements safely

---

## How Integration Works

1. **Vision detects objects** → sends data to navigation & manipulation  
2. **Navigation plans path** → moves robot to task location  
3. **Manipulation executes actions** → interacts with objects  
4. **LLM guides high-level decisions** → provides context & sequencing  

This forms a **closed-loop system** where perception, planning, and action work together.

## Benefits of Capstone Integration

- Realistic simulation → real robot deployment  
- Supports **multi-step autonomous tasks**  
- Enables **flexible and adaptive robot behavior**  
- Perfect for VLA (Vision-Language-Action) research and education

## Summary

Capstone Integration demonstrates the **full power of Physical AI**.  
Vision, navigation, manipulation, and LLM reasoning work together for autonomous, intelligent robotic systems.
