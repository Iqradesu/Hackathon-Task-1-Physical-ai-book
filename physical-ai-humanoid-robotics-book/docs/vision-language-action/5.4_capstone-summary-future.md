# 5.4 The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project and VLA Future

## Capstone Project Overview

The **Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project** combines all previously discussed components:

- **Vision** → detects objects and environment features  
- **Language** → interprets high-level instructions  
- **Action & Manipulation** → performs tasks with arms, hands, and locomotion  
- **Navigation** → plans safe paths in dynamic environments  

Goal: Build a humanoid robot capable of **complex, multi-step autonomous tasks**.
