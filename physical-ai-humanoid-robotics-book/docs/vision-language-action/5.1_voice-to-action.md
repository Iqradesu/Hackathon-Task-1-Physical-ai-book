# 5.1 Voice-to-Action Pipeline (Speech Recognition)

## What is the Voice-to-Action Pipeline?

The **Voice-to-Action Pipeline** enables robots to understand **spoken commands** and convert them into **actions**.

It combines:
- **Speech Recognition** → converts audio to text  
- **Language Understanding** → interprets the instruction  
- **Action Planning** → generates a plan to execute the task  

This allows humans to **control robots using natural language**.

## Speech Recognition

Speech recognition converts **spoken words into text**.

Key points:
- Uses **microphones or audio sensors**
- Handles noise and varying accents
- Outputs a textual transcription for the language model

---

## Integration with VLA

Once speech is transcribed:
1. The **language model** interprets intent
2. The **vision system** identifies relevant objects
3. The **action system** executes physical tasks

Example:
> “Pick up the green cube.”

- Vision detects the green cube  
- LLM plans a grasp and motion  
- Robot moves and picks the cube  

---

## Why This Pipeline Matters

- Enables **hands-free control**
- Supports **dynamic instructions**
- Improves **human-robot interaction (HRI)**

---

## Summary

The Voice-to-Action Pipeline bridges **speech and embodied intelligence**.  
It allows robots to understand human commands and act in real-world environments.
