# 5.2 Cognitive Planning: LLM-to-ROS 2 Action Translation

## What is Cognitive Planning?

**Cognitive Planning** connects **LLM reasoning** to **robot actions** in ROS 2.  
It translates **high-level instructions** into **concrete robot commands**.

Steps:
1. LLM interprets user goals and environment context  
2. Generates a **plan sequence**  
3. Sends commands to ROS 2 **action servers or nodes**  

This enables robots to perform complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Natural language command  
   Example:  
   > “Organize all red blocks on the table into a line.”

2. **LLM Planning**:
   - Breaks task into smaller steps  
   - Example steps:  
     - Detect all red blocks  
     - Pick up block A  
     - Move to target location  
     - Place block  

3. **Action Translation**:
   - Converts each step into **ROS 2 actions** or **service calls**  
   - Sends commands to actuators via ROS 2 topics or controllers

## Benefits

- Enables **dynamic and flexible task execution**  
- Bridges **high-level reasoning and low-level control**  
- Supports **multi-step autonomous operations**

## Example Integration

```python
# Pseudocode for translating LLM plan to ROS 2
for step in llm_plan:
    ros2_action_client.send_goal(step.action, step.parameters)
    ros2_action_client.wait_for_result()
```
This shows how each LLM step is executed sequentially via ROS 2 actions.

## Summary

Cognitive Planning allows LLMs to control robots intelligently.
It converts language-based goals into ROS 2 actionable commands, enabling autonomous, multi-step task execution.
