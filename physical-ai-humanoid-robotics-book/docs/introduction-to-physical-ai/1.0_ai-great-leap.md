# 1.0 The AI Great Leap: From Digital Computation to Physical Embodiment

## Introduction

The **AI Great Leap** describes the shift from purely digital computation to **physical embodiment**.  
Robots are no longer just software—they **sense, move, and interact** with the physical world.

---

## Key Points

- Traditional AI focused on **data and algorithms**  
- Physical AI integrates **sensors, actuators, and real-world interactions**  
- Enables **robots to learn from the environment** rather than just process data

---

## Examples

- Autonomous drones navigating indoors  
- Robotic arms assembling parts in factories  
- Humanoid robots interacting safely with humans

---

## Why This Matters

- Moves AI from **virtual tasks** to **real-world applications**  
- Allows **embodied intelligence**, combining perception, reasoning, and action  
- Essential for **next-generation robotics and physical AI research**

---

## Summary

The AI Great Leap bridges **digital intelligence** and **physical action**.  
It sets the foundation for **Physical AI**, where robots **see, think, and act** in the real world.
