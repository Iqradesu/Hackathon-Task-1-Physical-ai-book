# 1.3 Essential Sensor Systems for Physical AI and Robotics

## Introduction

Sensors allow robots to **perceive their environment** and gather data to make intelligent decisions.  
They are the **eyes, ears, and touch of Physical AI systems**.

## Key Sensor Types

1. **Vision Sensors**
   - Cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR  
   - Used for **object detection, navigation, and mapping**  

2. **Tactile Sensors**
   - Touch and pressure sensors on grippers or skin  
   - Provide feedback for **safe manipulation** and **force control**

3. **Proprioceptive Sensors**
   - Encoders, IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)  
   - Measure **robot position, orientation, and motion**

4. **Auditory Sensors**
   - Microphones for sound detection and speech recognition  
   - Enable **voice-to-action commands** and environmental awareness

## Why Sensors Are Important

- Enable **real-time decision-making**  
- Provide data for **LLM-guided planning** and autonomous actions  
- Allow robots to **interact safely and adaptively** with the physical world

## Summary

Sensors are the foundation of Physical AI.  
They provide **perception data** for navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction, enabling robots to act intelligently.
