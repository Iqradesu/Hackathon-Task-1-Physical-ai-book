# 1.1 Core Definitions: Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that **interact directly with the physical world**.  
Unlike purely digital AI, these systems can **sense, move, and manipulate objects**.

Key aspects:
- **Sensors** detect the environment  
- **Actuators** enable movement and interaction  
- **Algorithms** process data to make decisions in real time

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

**Embodied Intelligence** is the ability of a system to **learn and adapt through physical interactions**.  
It emphasizes that **cognition is shaped by the body and environment**.

Key points:
- Intelligence is not only in the software, but also in **how the body acts and perceives**  
- Robots learn better when they can **physically explore** their surroundings  
- Supports **adaptive, flexible, and autonomous behavior**

## Why These Definitions Matter

- Helps distinguish **physical AI from traditional AI**  
- Provides a framework for designing **robots that act intelligently in the real world**  
- Lays the foundation for **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems**

---

## Summary

Physical AI + Embodied Intelligence = **intelligent systems that perceive, act, and learn** in the real world.  
This is the foundation for **humanoid robots, autonomous agents, and VLA paradigms**.
