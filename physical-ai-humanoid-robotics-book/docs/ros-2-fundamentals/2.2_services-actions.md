# 2.2 Synchronous Command and Control: Services and Actions

While topics are great for continuous data streams, there are many situations where a robot needs to perform a discrete task and report back when it's done. For this, ROS 2 provides two synchronous communication mechanisms: **Services** and **Actions**.

## Services: Request-Reply Communication

A **service** is a request-reply communication pattern. It is similar to a remote procedure call (RPC). In a service, one node (the **client**) sends a request to another node (the **server**), and the server sends back a reply.

Unlike topics, services are **synchronous**. This means that when a client sends a request, it waits until it receives a reply from the server. This makes services ideal for tasks that have a clear beginning and end, and where the client needs to know when the task is complete.

For example, you might use a service to:
-   Change a setting on a robot.
-   Ask a robot for its current position.
-   Tell a robot to perform a specific, short-running task.

A service is defined by a `.srv` file, which specifies the types of the request and response messages.

## Actions: For Long-Running Tasks

**Actions** are similar to services, but they are designed for long-running tasks. Like services, actions have a request-reply pattern. However, they also provide feedback on the progress of the task, and they can be preempted (cancelled) by the client.

An action has three parts:
-   A **goal**: The request sent by the client to the server.
-   A **result**: The reply sent by the server to the client when the task is complete.
-   **Feedback**: A stream of messages sent by the server to the client to provide updates on the progress of the task.

For example, you might use an action to:
-   Tell a robot to navigate to a specific location.
-   Tell a robot to pick up an object.
-   Tell a robot to perform a complex sequence of movements.

An action is defined by a `.action` file, which specifies the types of the goal, result, and feedback messages.

By providing both services and actions, ROS 2 gives you the flexibility to choose the right communication mechanism for your needs, whether you're sending a quick command or starting a long-running, complex task.
