# 2.2 Synchronous Command and Control: Services and Actions

## What are Services?

**Services** provide **synchronous request-response communication** between nodes.  
- One node sends a request, and another node replies with a response.  
- Useful for tasks that need a **specific answer immediately**.  

Example:  
- A path planning node receives a request from a robot node to compute a route.  
- The path planning node sends back the computed path as a response.

## What are Actions?

**Actions** handle **long-running tasks** with feedback.  
- Nodes can start an action, get updates during execution, and receive a result when finished.  
- Actions are ideal for tasks that take time, like moving an arm or navigating a robot.  

Example:  
- A robot arm moves to a target position while providing feedback on its progress.  
- Other nodes can monitor or cancel the action if needed.

## Why Services and Actions Matter

- Services = synchronous, short-term tasks with immediate response  
- Actions = asynchronous tasks with progress updates and results  
- Together, they complement **topics** for a complete communication system in ROS 2  
- Enable precise **command and control** for robots

## Summary

- Services allow **request-response** interactions between nodes  
- Actions handle **long-running, monitored tasks**  
- Using topics, services, and actions together enables **robust robot control** in ROS 2
