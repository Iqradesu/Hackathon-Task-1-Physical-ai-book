# 2.0 ROS 2 Architecture and Middleware

## Introduction

**ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) is a **framework for building robot software**.  
It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to **develop, test, and run robotic systems** efficiently.

## Key Concepts

1. **Middleware**
   - Handles **communication between nodes**  
   - Supports **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** for reliable messaging

2. **Nodes**
   - Independent modules that perform **specific tasks**  
   - Can publish/subscribe to **topics** or offer **services/actions**

3. **Topics**
   - Channels for **asynchronous message passing**  
   - Example: a camera node publishes images on a topic for other nodes to read

4. **Services & Actions**
   - **Services** → synchronous request-response operations  
   - **Actions** → asynchronous, long-running tasks with feedback

## Why ROS 2 Matters

- Decouples robot **hardware and software**  
- Supports **distributed, modular, and scalable systems**  
- Enables **rapid prototyping** and integration of complex systems

## Summary

ROS 2 provides the **architecture and middleware** for building modern robotic systems.  
It is the backbone for **modular, distributed, and intelligent robot software**.
