# 2.0 ROS 2 Architecture and Middleware

## The Purpose of ROS 2

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. The "2" in ROS 2 signifies a major redesign of the original ROS, built to address the needs of modern robotics, including multi-robot systems, real-time control, and use in commercial products.

At its core, ROS 2 is not an operating system in the traditional sense, like Windows or Linux. Instead, it is **middleware**. Middleware is software that provides services to applications beyond those available from the operating system. It acts as a communication layer, allowing different parts of a robot's software to communicate with each other, even if they are written in different programming languages or running on different computers.

## The Modular Architecture of ROS 2

ROS 2 is designed to be highly modular. This means that a robot's software is built from many small, independent programs called **nodes**. Each node is responsible for a specific task, such as reading data from a sensor, controlling a motor, or planning a path.

This modularity has several advantages:
- **Reusability**: A node written for one robot can often be reused on another robot with minimal changes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If a node crashes, it does not necessarily bring down the entire system. Other nodes can continue to function.
- **Flexibility**: Nodes can be started, stopped, and replaced at runtime, allowing for dynamic changes to the robot's behavior.
- **Distributed Systems**: Nodes can run on different computers, allowing for the creation of complex, distributed robotic systems.

The communication between nodes is handled by the ROS 2 middleware, which is based on a **publish-subscribe** pattern. We will explore this and other communication patterns in the following sections.
