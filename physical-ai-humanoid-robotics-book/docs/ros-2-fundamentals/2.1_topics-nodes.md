# 2.1 Asynchronous Data Flow: Nodes and Topics

## What are Nodes?

**Nodes** are the building blocks of a ROS 2 system.  
- Each node is a small program that performs a specific task.  
- Examples: reading sensors, controlling motors, or processing camera images.  

Nodes allow a robot system to be **modular**, so different tasks can run independently.

## What are Topics?

**Topics** are channels for **asynchronous communication** between nodes.  
- Nodes can **publish** messages to a topic.  
- Other nodes can **subscribe** to that topic to receive messages.  

Example:  
- A camera node publishes images to the `/camera` topic.  
- A processing node subscribes to `/camera` to analyze the images in real time.

## Why Asynchronous Data Flow Matters

- Nodes can run independently without blocking each other  
- Topics allow **real-time communication** across different modules  
- This makes ROS 2 suitable for **complex, distributed, or multi-robot systems**

## Summary

- Nodes = independent programs performing specific tasks  
- Topics = channels for nodes to share messages asynchronously  
- Asynchronous data flow enables modular, scalable, and real-time robot systems
