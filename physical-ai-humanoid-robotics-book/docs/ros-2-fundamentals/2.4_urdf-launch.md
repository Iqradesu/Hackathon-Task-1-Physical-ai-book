# 2.4 Robot Description and Runtime Configuration

In addition to communication, ROS 2 provides powerful tools for describing and configuring a robotic system. In this section, we will cover the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), launch files, and parameters.

## URDF: Describing the Robot's Body

The **Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)** is an XML format for representing a robot model. In ROS, URDF is the standard way to describe the physical structure of a robot.

A URDF file defines the robot's **links** (the rigid parts of the robot) and **joints** (the connections between links). It also specifies the robot's kinematic and dynamic properties, such as the size, shape, mass, and inertia of each link.

By creating a URDF file for your robot, you can:
-   Visualize the robot in 3D using tools like RViz.
-   Perform collision checking.
-   Use robot simulators like Gazebo.
-   Use kinematic and motion planning libraries.

While the full URDF specification can be complex, understanding the basic structure of links and joints is a crucial first step in working with robot models in ROS.

## Launch Files: Starting a Complex System

A ROS 2 system can be composed of many nodes, each of which needs to be started with specific configurations. Starting each node manually in a separate terminal would be tedious and error-prone.

**Launch files** provide a way to start and configure a collection of nodes. A launch file is a Python script that can:
-   Start multiple nodes.
-   Set parameters for nodes.
-   Remap topic names.
-   Start other launch files.

By using launch files, you can start your entire robotic system with a single command. This makes it easy to manage complex systems and ensures that all nodes are started with the correct configuration.

## Parameters: Configuring Nodes at Runtime

**Parameters** are a way to configure nodes at runtime. A parameter is a value that is stored on a node and can be changed from the command line, in a launch file, or by another node.

Parameters are useful for tuning the behavior of a node without having to recompile the code. For example, you might use a parameter to:
-   Set the speed of a robot.
-   Adjust the sensitivity of a sensor.
-   Enable or disable a specific feature.

Each node has a set of parameters that it can use. You can list the parameters of a node, get the value of a parameter, and set the value of a parameter using the command line or from another node.

Together, URDF, launch files, and parameters provide a powerful and flexible way to describe, configure, and manage a robotic system in ROS 2.
